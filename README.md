# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Approach

As the front end was already created and linked, I needed to look at connecting this to the backend. I broke down the problem into smaller objectives to make it easy:

1. Start a server using Express
2. The post method needs to write the note to the JSON file for retrieval
3. The save method needs to locate and save specific notes from the server

## User Story

## Challenges

understand pathing with Express 
 need deep reading into documentation of the package and extra research
